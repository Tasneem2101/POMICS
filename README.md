# POMICS
 This is a Genomics Student Project
 This project can be described simply as a protein sequence analysis tool.
 You upload DNA file in the FASTA format and it will be transcripted then translated into ots corresponding protein sequence.
 THEN, we do some analysis on this protein sequence to get some data and represent it in a web page using streamlit library.
 
	
	
	
 
 # How To Run ?!
 		you can run this project from the terminal using "streamlit run bioAPP.py" command.
			




# Info about POMICS Website..

This website includes 5 pages :
INTRO ---> contains a brief about the website.
DNA Sequence ----> you can upload any DNA file and its analysis will be represented.
Covid-Sequence-Analysis ----> in this page we used covid virus sequence and we analysed it.
DotPlot ----> you can upload two DNA files and the will be aligned and give some data about the alignment such as alignment score and alignment plotting based on nulceotide number.
